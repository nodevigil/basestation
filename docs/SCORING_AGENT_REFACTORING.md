# Scoring Agent Refactoring - Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the trust scoring logic from the `ProcessorAgent` into a dedicated `ScoringAgent`. This improves the architecture by implementing proper separation of concerns and makes the scoring functionality reusable and independently executable.

## Changes Made

### 1. New ScoringAgent (`/agents/score/scoring_agent.py`)
- **Created**: New dedicated agent for computing trust scores and risk classifications
- **Features**:
  - Computes trust scores based on security analysis
  - Classifies risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - Generates detailed scoring summaries and statistics
  - Supports both batch and single result scoring
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. ProcessorAgent Refactoring (`/agents/process/processor_agent.py`)
- **Removed**: Trust scoring logic and related methods
- **Updated**: Now delegates scoring to the new `ScoringAgent`
- **Simplified**: Focus remains on data processing, enrichment, and deduplication
- **Maintained**: All existing functionality while improving modularity

### 3. Pipeline Enhancement (`/utils/pipeline.py`)
- **Added**: `run_scoring_stage()` method for independent scoring execution
- **Updated**: `run_single_stage()` method to handle 'score' stage
- **Enhanced**: Better stage isolation and execution control

### 4. Agent Registry (`/utils/agent_registry.py`)
- **Updated**: Now discovers scoring agents in the `/agents/score/` directory
- **Registered**: Scoring agents as process agents for compatibility

### 5. Main Interface (`/main.py`)
- **Added**: Support for `--stage score` command-line option
- **Updated**: Help text and argument parsing to include scoring stage
- **Enhanced**: Better user experience with dedicated scoring stage

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Monolithic)
```
ProcessorAgent:
├── Deduplication
├── Trust Scoring ← Mixed concerns
├── Risk Classification ← Mixed concerns  
├── Data Enrichment
└── Database Updates
```

### After (Modular)
```
ProcessorAgent:          ScoringAgent:
├── Deduplication       ├── Trust Scoring
├── Data Enrichment ──→ ├── Risk Classification
└── Database Updates    └── Scoring Statistics
```

## Usage Examples

### Independent Scoring
```bash
# Run only the scoring stage
python main.py --stage score

# Use specific scoring agent
python main.py --stage score --agent ScoringAgent
```

### Pipeline Integration  
```bash
# Full pipeline (includes scoring within processing)
python main.py

# Step-by-step execution
python main.py --stage recon
python main.py --stage scan  
python main.py --stage score    # ← New independent stage
python main.py --stage process  # ← Now focused on enrichment
python main.py --stage publish
```

### Agent Discovery
```bash
# List all available agents (includes ScoringAgent)
python main.py --list-agents
```

## Technical Details

### Trust Scoring Algorithm (Unchanged)
- **Base Score**: 100 points
- **Deductions**:
  - Docker socket exposed: -30 points (Critical)
  - SSH port open: -10 points (Medium)
  - TLS misconfigured: -25 points (High)
  - Each vulnerability: -15 points (High)

### Risk Classification (Enhanced)
- **LOW**: 90-100 points
- **MEDIUM**: 70-89 points  
- **HIGH**: 50-69 points
- **CRITICAL**: <50 points

### Scoring Output Format
```json
{
  "trust_score": 85,
  "risk_level": "MEDIUM",
  "trust_flags": ["SSH port open"],
  "trust_summary": "Trust Score: 85. Flags: SSH port open.",
  "scoring_timestamp": "2025-06-18T12:31:13.000Z",
  "docker_exposure": {"exposed": false}
}
```

## Testing Verified

✅ **ScoringAgent Import**: Successfully imports and initializes
✅ **Agent Discovery**: Properly discovered by agent registry  
✅ **Trust Scoring**: Correctly computes scores and risk levels
✅ **CLI Integration**: New `--stage score` option works
✅ **Pipeline Compatibility**: Maintains full pipeline functionality
✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing ProcessorAgent continues to work
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Scoring can now be run independently
- **Improved Testing**: Scoring logic can be tested in isolation
- **Better Monitoring**: Dedicated scoring metrics and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**: Consider batch scoring optimizations
2. **Custom Scoring**: Add support for custom scoring algorithms
3. **Scoring Profiles**: Support different scoring profiles per protocol
4. **Real-time Scoring**: Add streaming/real-time scoring capabilities
5. **Machine Learning**: Integrate ML-based risk assessment models
